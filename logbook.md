# Project Meetings

## Week 2 10-09-24:

We also skipped out meetings as the we other assigment that were urgent.

## Week 4 24-09-24:

## Week 5 01-10-24:
We started on the projekt plan (and everything that includes). We need to finish project canvas, create a garnt chart and read through the introduction and data description to ensure its understandable. We also wrote the coorporation agreement, which we need to sign before sunday.

We met for the first time with the supervisor and talked about the possible project we can work with him on.

## Week 2 12-09-24: 
We talked about the project and recieved a research paper (DUDES: Deep Uncertainty Distillation using Ensembles for Semantic Segmentation) that we should read.

## Week 3 19-09-24:
Supervisor was at a conference so the meeting was postponned to the next week

## Week 4 26-09-24:
Talked more indepth about the project. About the architecture and how our project differs from the paper we recived last week. And agreed upon the date for the first deliverable (Project plan etc.)

## Week 5 03-10-24:
### Questions:
- Method walktrough

short description of llms
distilation
evaluation metrics
ensemble consists of mlp

- Project title? suggestion: Distillation of Deep Ensemble for Uncertainty Quantification for Semantic Classification

Yes
- Code base are we starting from scratch?

Yes, but most of the first part of the project should have code that could be used on the web
- Approval of the research questions

Rephrase the questions and send them to michael to get approvel
- Guidance on how to better write a logbook

Expand the description of the meetings relating the decesions and considerations. Make it more clear what we got out of the meeting

- Are we sending the first handin to both Michael and Morten?

Yes
- In the context of research question 3 how does out-of-distribution relate to text classification.

Find a different dataset maybe in danish and test the models on that

### Next steps:
Decide on a LLM and train a MLP

New meeting time: Wednsday 10.15 from the 16 october

## Week 6 10-10-24:
